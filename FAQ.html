                                    Tuk Tuk is one of Egypt's newest means of transportation. They are found in many
                                    governorates and many areas and they are common in towns and small villages. Tuk Tuk
                                    has
                                    advantages; for example, the fare of it is inexpensive, it can easily go into small
                                    and
                                    crowded routes. It has also disadvantages; for instance, it is considered to be
                                    unsafe,
                                    it does not transport you to popular destinations but only within the boundaries of

                                    <strong>Taxis</strong> <br>
                                    Taxis are one of the most preferable means in Egypt because they are faster and more
                                    relaxed.
                                    However, they are more expensive than other means and sometimes you may be cheated
                                    in the fare;
                                    so that, it is better to ask the driver to operate the meter or agree with him on
                                    the fare.
                                    There are no taxi stations but you can stop any taxi on the road.
                                    It is worthy to mention here Uber and Careem services which are
                                    the types of private cars reserved from a specific application from your mobile
                                    store.
                                    They are better than the usual taxi because you know the fare before you take your
                                    ride
                                    and the fare is calculated based on a particular system. Moreover, their cars are
                                    faster and more convenient.
                                    You will never be lost with the drivers because they use GPS to know the best and
                                    fastest way.

                                    <strong>Buses</strong> <br>
                                    Buses are one of the most popular means of transportation in Egypt. They are widely
                                    spread in Cairo and Giza besides a large number of governorates such as Alexandria,
                                    Port Said, Ismailia, \Sharm El Sheikh and North and South Sinai. The bus is not the
                                    best means to move around because of its slowness due to stopping at several
                                    stations, the heavy congestion and the difficulty of finding a place to sit during
                                    the peak hours. However, it is considered to be one of the cheapest transportation
                                    means and it is easily accessed. When you pay the fare, you should take a ticket to
                                    prove your payment later. Each bus has a particular line along with a specific
                                    number written in Arabic on the front in the driver's area

                                    other governorates. They are different from buses in many things; they are smaller
                                    than buses, you have to sit because there is no place to stand up which makes
                                    microbus as a transport better than the bus, the fare differs from place to another
                                    regarding the distance and there is no ticket. Microbuses are easily accessed as you
                                    can find it at certain stations and you can stop it in the road

                                    The Egyptian railway system is the oldest railway network in Africa and the Middle
                                    East. It is the best way for long journeys not shorter ones such as Cairo to
                                    Alexandria travel because shorter journeys are usually slower and less comfortable.
                                    There are three classes of carriage on the train; the first and the second ones may
                                    be air-conditioned. You can enjoy air-conditioned trains and sleeping trains but the
                                    price will be much more than normal ones. You can easily know the timetable for
                                    mainline trains as it is published every six months. Trains are considered to be a
                                    safe means of transportation in Egypt
