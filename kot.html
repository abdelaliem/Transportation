        <h3>Metro</h3>
        <p>
          The metro system or the subway metro is in Cairo covering many areas.
          It has 3 lines and it covers 92 stations over the city.
          The third line is more developed and more comfortable than
          the first and the second one. The fourth line will be opened soon.
        </p>
        <h3>Railways</h3>
        <p>
          The Egyptian railway system is the oldest railway network in Africa and the Middle East.
          It is the best way for long journeys not shorter ones such as Cairo to Alexandria travel
          because shorter journeys are usually slower and less comfortable.
          There are three classes of carriage on the train; the first and the second ones may be air-conditioned.
          You can enjoy air-conditioned trains and sleeping trains but the price will be much more than normal ones.
          You can easily know the timetable for mainline trains as it is published every six months.
          Trains are considered to be a safe means of transportation in Egypt.
        </p>

        <h3>Buses</h3>
        <p>
          Buses are one of the most popular means of transportation in Egypt.
          They are widely spread in Cairo
          and Giza besides a large number of governorates such as Alexandria, Port Said, Ismailia,
          \Sharm El Sheikh and North and South Sinai. The bus is not the best means to move
          around because of its slowness due to stopping at several stations, the heavy congestion
          and the difficulty of finding a place to sit during the peak hours. However,
          it is considered to be one of the cheapest transportation means and it is easily accessed.
          When you pay the fare, you should take a ticket to prove your payment later.
          Each bus has a particular line along with a specific
          number written in Arabic on the front in the driver's area
        </p>

        <h3>Microbuses</h3>
        <p>
          Microbuses are well known for their high speed. They are also very widespread in Cairo and all other
          governorates.
          They are different from buses in many things; they are smaller than buses,
          you have to sit because there is no place to stand up which makes microbus as a transport better than the bus,
          the fare differs from place to another regarding the distance and there is no ticket.
          Microbuses are easily accessed as you can find it at certain stations and you can stop it in the road.
        </p>

        <h3>Taxis</h3>
        <p>
          Taxis are one of the most preferable means in Egypt because they are faster and more relaxed.
          However, they are more expensive than other means and sometimes you may be cheated in the fare;
          so that, it is better to ask the driver to operate the meter or agree with him on the fare.
          There are no taxi stations but you can stop any taxi on the road.
          It is worthy to mention here Uber and Careem services which are the types of private
          cars reserved from a specific application from your mobile store. They are better than the usual
          taxi because you know the fare before you take your ride and the fare is calculated
          based on a particular system. Moreover, their cars are faster and more convenient.
          You will never be lost with the drivers because they use GPS to know the best and fastest way.
        </p>

        <h3>Tuk Tuk</h3>
        <p>
          Tuk Tuk is one of Egypt's newest means of transportation. They are found in many governorates and many areas
          and they are common in towns and small villages. Tuk Tuk has advantages; for example, the fare of it is
          inexpensive, it can easily go into small and crowded routes. It has also disadvantages; for instance, it is
          considered to be unsafe, it does not transport you to popular destinations but only within the boundaries of
          small areas.
